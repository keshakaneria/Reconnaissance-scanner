# Reconnaissance-tool

## About the project

Our goal is to build a tool in Python that allows us to do it all in a single click. So again what the tool is going to do is that you have to just type the website url like “facebook.com” and hit the button to get a particular information . It will grab all the information for you. So it’s pretty cool. This Scanner will provide you the information like ipAddress, open ports, location, Tech stack used, Ports service Info, Public directory,Os Info. For eg If you want to find an ipAddress of a particular website, just paste the site in the search bar and click the ipAddress button, it will provide you the ipAddress of that website.
- For ipAddress it will provide ipAddress of that particular website.
- For open ports, it will provide you all the ports of the website which are currently open.
- For Location, it will provide the location of the domain.
- For Tech stack used, it will provide you with all the technology which is used to develop a particular website like by which programming language this website is developed, which database is used for storing information, which servers are used by the website etc.
- For Os Info, it will provide all information regarding the OS.
- For port service Info, it will provide the name of the port services available.
- For public directories, it will provide a robot.txt file which tells search engine crawlers which pages or files the crawler can or can't request from your site. This is used mainly to avoid overloading your site with requests.
